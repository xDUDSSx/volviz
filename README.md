# Direct volume renderer using THREE.js
## Illustrative visualization of volumetric data
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This project implements three different illustrative techniques for the visualization of volume data and allows the user to switch between the techniques and interactively change various parameters.
The renderer is using THREE.js and WebGL 2. The volumetric data is raymarched inside GLSL shaders.

## Running
`npm start` to start the webpack developement server at http://localhost:8080

`npm run build` bundles the project into the folder `./build/`. https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/.  
Note that this folder should not exist prior to building.
