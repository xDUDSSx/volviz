# Direct volume renderer using THREE.js
## Illustrative visualization of volumetric data
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This project implements three different illustrative techniques for the visualization of volume data and allows the user to switch between the techniques and interactively change various parameters.
The renderer is using THREE.js and WebGL 2. The volumetric data is raymarched inside GLSL shaders.

## Running the dev server
```bash
npm start
```

## Building the project for the web
Once you are happy with your project you'll be sure to want to show it off. Running `npm run build` in terminal will bundle your project into the folder `./build/`. You can upload this directory to a web server. For more complex results read [this guide](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/).
